## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

### STEP ! - INSTALLING THE NGINX WEB SERVER

#### Steps

* Start by updating the server package followed by Installing the Nginx.

```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install
```

* Next confirm Nginx is properly configured by running.

```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

* The Green indicator shows that the server was successfully installed and is running.
![Nginx Status](./images/1%20-%20Nginx%20Status.png "Nginx installed Correctly")

* Next we can test connection to our servers in two ways; either locally or through the browser.

```
curl http://localhost:80
or
curl http://127.0.0.1:80
```

### STEP 2 - INSTALLING MYSQL

#### Steps

* Use the following command to install MYSQL:
```
sudo apt install mysql-server
``` 
* If prompted, type Y and hit the enter key to continue installation.

* Next, log into MySQL using:
``` 
sudo mysql
```

* It’s recommended that you run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. Before running the script you will set a password for the root user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. We’re defining this user’s password as PassWord.1.
![Security Script](./images/4%20-%20Security_Script.png "Securing the sql database")
* Exit SQL interactive shell by typing ```quit```.
* Start interactive scripting to configure the validate password pluggin. Run: sudo mysql_secure_installation and answer Y to all the prompts. At the point you can change the password of your root user and also decide the level of password validation.
![My SQL Console](./images/5%20-%20MySQL_Console.png "mysql console")
* When done, test to know if login to the console is possible. type: ```sudo mysql -p```
* This would prompt you to enter root user password. Enter the choosen password
* Type exit to exit MySQL console.

### STEP 3 - INSTALLING PHP
#### Steps

* Installl PHP to process code and generate dynamic content for the web server using the following command
```
sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql
```
* When pompted type ```Y``` and press ```Enter```.
* PHP is successfuly Installed and configured.

### STEP 4 - CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR

#### Steps

* PHP is installed. Next is to configure Nginx to use php components.
* create a root web directory for domain as follows: ``` sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP ```
* Proceed to change ownership of this directory: ``` sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP ```
* Using any text editor, create a new configuration file for the domain: ``` sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP ```
* once the new file is opened, enter the following configuration:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
```
* Activate the configuration by linking to the config file from Nginx's ``` sites-enabled ``` directory:
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
* Test the configuration using ``` sudo nginx -t ```
* ![Nginx Test](./images/7%20-%20Nginx_test.png "test is ok")
* Disable the default nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80, for this, run: ``` sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default ```
* Then restart nginx: ``` sudo systemctl reload nginx ```
* We can then create an index.html file in the new location to test that the new server block works as expected:
```
sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html
```
* From your browser, try and open the url using IP address ``` http://<public-IP-Address>:80```
* Your LEMP stack is now fully configured. In the next step, we’ll create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle .php files within your newly configured website.
